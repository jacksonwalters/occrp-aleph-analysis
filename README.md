Analysis of datasets available through [OCCRP Aleph](https://aleph.occrp.org/). Primarily using NLP and network tools in Python.

## aleph client tools

A download tool for aleph datasets is available as a command line tool via PyPi:

[https://pypi.org/project/alephclient/](https://pypi.org/project/alephclient/)

```
pip install alephclient
```

The documentation is available here:

[https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/)

To download datasets, first export the host URL and your Aleph API key:

```
export ALEPHCLIENT_HOST=https://aleph.occrp.org/
export ALEPHCLIENT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Identify the foreign ID of the dataset in Aleph (visibile in the bottom right hand corner):

```
-f, --foreign-id TEXT    foreign_id of the collection  [required]
```

Finally, run the command to download datasets to the specified directory:

```
alephclient fetchdir --foreign-id <some-foreign-id> --prefix ~/Downloads
```
